here i will tell you, teacher
how i made the steps 5 and 6 through commands in git bash

first of all, you open up a file with the "nano" command and the name of the file
you want to edit or/and rename. Then it opens up a interface where you can see 
your text and therefore edit it. When you're done editing, you press ctrl + x and you say that
you wanna save the changes. After that it will ask you to name it, put the name
that you wish, and save it. 

And for the 6th step, you do the same, but only text "nano", write what you desire
and then you save with a name and format. Try it yourself if you don't believe me.
